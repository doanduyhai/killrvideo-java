# KillrVideo Java #

A reference application for Java developers looking to learn more about using [Apache Cassandra][cassandra] and
[DataStax Enterprise][dse] in their applications and services. Learn more at [KillrVideo].

NOTE: This Java implementation project is currently in a state of transition moving to the [DSE Java driver], so
expect consistent updates.  This README will be updated once things are in a steady state.

## Running Locally

Use these guides to get started running KillrVideo locally on your development machine:
* [Getting Started with KillrVideo][getting-started]: Follow this to setup common dependencies like Docker.
* [Getting Started with Java][getting-started-java]: Follow this to get this Java code 
running.
  

## Pull Requests, Requests for More Examples
This project will continue to evolve along with Cassandra and you can expect that as Cassandra and the DataStax 
driver add new features. This sample application will try and provide examples of those. 

I'll gladly accept any pull requests for bug fixes, new features, etc.  and if you have a request for an example 
that you don't see in the code currently, send me a message [@SonicDMG][twitter] on Twitter or open an issue 
[here][issues] on GitHub.
